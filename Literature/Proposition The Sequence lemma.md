# The Sequence lemma

## Proposition

**Proposition**. Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[Topological Space]] and $A$ a subset of $X$. If there exists a [[Sequence]] $\{a_i\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ in $A$ that [[Convergence of a Sequence|converges]] to $p$, then $p \in cl(A)$. The converse is true if $X$ is [[First Countable]].
