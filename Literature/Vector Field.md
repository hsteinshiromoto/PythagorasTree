# Vector Field

## Definition

**Definition**. A _vector field_ $X$ on an [[Open Set|open]] subset $U$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a function that assigns to each point $p\in U$ a [[Tangent Space|tangent vector]] $X_p \in T_p(\mathbb{R}^n)$. 

From the [[Corollary Tangent Vectors are Derivations|corollary that tangent vectors are derivations]], $T_p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ has basis $\{\partial/\partial x^i|_p\}$, the vector $X_p$ is a linear combination
$$X_p=\sum_{i=1}^na^i(p)\left.\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_p\;, p\in U\;,a^i(p)\in\mathbb{R}\;.$$
