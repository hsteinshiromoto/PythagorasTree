# Derivation

## Definition

**Definition**. Let $v$ be a [[Tangent Space|tangent vector]] at a point $p\in\mathbb{R}^n$, the mapping $D_v:\mathcal{C}^\infty_p\to\mathbb{R}$ defined by [[directional derivative]] at $p$ is  said to be a _derivation at_ $p$. The set of all derivations at $p$ is denoted as $\mathcal{D}_p(\mathbb{R}^n)$.
