# Dual Space

## Definition

**Definition**. Let $V$ and $W$ be real vector spaces, the vector space composed of all linear maps $f:V\to W$ is denoted by Hom$(V,W)$. The _dual space_ $V^V$ of $V$ the is the space of all real-valued linear functions on $V$ $$V^V=\text{Hom}(V,\mathbb{R})\;.$$
The elements of $V^V$ said to be _covectors_ or _$1-$covectors_ on $V$.
