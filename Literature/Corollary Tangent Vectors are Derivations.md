# Tangent Vectors are Derivations

## Corollary

**Corollary**. Under the [[theorem tangent vectors are derivations]], the canonical basis $\{e_1,\ldots,e_n\}$ for $T_p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ corresponds to the set 
$$\left\{\left.\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x^1}\right|_p,\cdots,\left.\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x^n}\right|_p\right\}$$
of partial derivatives. Furthermore, a vector $v=v^1e_1+\cdots+v^ne_n$ of $T_p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is can be rewritten as
$$v=\sum_{i=1}^nv^i\left.\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_p\;.$$
