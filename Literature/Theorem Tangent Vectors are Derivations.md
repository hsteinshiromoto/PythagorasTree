# Tangent Vectors are Derivations

## Theorem

**Theorem**. Consider the mapping between the [[tangent space]] at $p$ and the set of all [[Derivation|derivations]] at $p$ defined as
$$\begin{array}{rrcl}
\phi:&T_p(\mathbb{R}^n)&\to&\mathcal{D}_p(\mathbb{R}^n)\\
&v&\mapsto&D_v=\sum_{i}v^i\left.\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_p\;.
\end{array}$$
Then, $\phi$ is an isomorphism between vector spaces.
