# Continuous Function

## Definition

**Definition**. Let $(X, \tau_X)$ and $(Y,\tau_Y)$ be [[Topological Space|topological spaces]]. A function $f:X\to Y$ is said to be _continuous at a point_ $x \in X$ if, for every [[neighborhood]] $N_Y$ of $f(x)\subset Y$, there exists a [[neighborhood]] $N_X$ of $x\in X$ such that the relation $x\in N_X$ implies $f(x)\in N_Y$. In addition, $f$ is _continuous on_ $X$ if it is continuous at every point of $X$.
