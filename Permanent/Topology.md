# Topology

## Definition

**Definition**. Let $X$ be a set, a family $\tau$ of subsets of $X$ is a *topology* on $X$ if
- The whole set and the empty set belong to the topology: $X\in\tau,\emptyset\in\tau\;.$
- The union of any collection of subsets of $\tau$ belongs to $\tau$: $$\{X_i\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}\subseteq\tau\Rightarrow\bigcup_{i\in\mathbb{N}}X_i\in\tau\;.$$
- The intersection of any finite collection of subsets of $\tau$ belongs to $\tau$: $$\{X_i\}_{i=1}^n\subseteq\tau\Rightarrow\bigcap_{i=1}^nX_i\in\tau\;.$$
