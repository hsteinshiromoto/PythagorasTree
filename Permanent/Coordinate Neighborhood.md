# Coordinate Neighborhood

## Definition

**Definition**. Let $M$ be a [[manifold]], $N(p)$ a [[neighborhood]] of a point $p\in M$ and $U\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ an [[open set]]. The [[homeomorphism]] of the [[locally Euclidean]] property 
$$\begin{array}{rrcl}
\varphi:&N(p)&\to&U\\
&q&\mapsto&\varphi(q)=(x^1(q),\ldots,x^n(q))
\end{array}$$
is said to be a _coordinate neighborhood_. The numbers $(x^1(q),\ldots,x^n(q))$ are said to be _coordinates of q_.
