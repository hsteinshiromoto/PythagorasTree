# Cauchy Sequence

## Definition

**Definition**. Let $(X, d)$ be a [[metric space]]. A [[sequence]] of points $\{x_i\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ in $X$ is said to be a _Cauchy sequence_  if, for every $r\in\mathbb{R}_{>0}$, there exists $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that, for every $m,n\in\mathbb{N}_{>N}$, the inequality $d(x_m,x_n)<r$ holds.
