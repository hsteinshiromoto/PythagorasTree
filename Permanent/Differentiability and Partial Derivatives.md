# Differentiability and Partial Derivatives

## Proposition

**Proposition**. Let $U\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be an [[open set]], if the function $f:U\to\mathbb{R}$ is [[differentiable]] at $a\in U$, then it is [[Continuous Function|continuous]] at $a$ and all the [[Partial Derivative|partial derivatives]] exist at $a$. Moreover, $b_i$ are uniquely determined for each $a$ which $f$ is [[differentiable]]; in fact
$$b_i=\left.\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}\right|_a\;.$$
Conversely, if the [[Partial Derivative|partial derivatives]] of $f$ at $a$ exist and are [[Continuous Function|continuous]], then $f$ is [[differentiable]] at $a$.
