# Convergence of a Sequence

## Definition

**Definition**. A [[sequence]] $\{x_i\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ is said to _converge_ to $p$ if, for every [[neighborhood]] $U$ of $p$, there exists a positive integer $N$ such that for all $i \geq N, x_i\in U$. In this case $p$ is said to be  a _limit of the [[sequence]]_ $\{x_i\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ and denoted as  $x_i \to p$ or $\lim_{i\to\infty} x_i =p$.
