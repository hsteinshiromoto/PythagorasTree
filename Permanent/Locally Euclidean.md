# Locally Euclidean

## Definition

**Definition**. A [[topological space]] $(X,\tau)$ is said to be _locally Euclidean of dimension_ $n$ if there exists $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that, for every $x\in X$, there exists a [[neighborhood]] $N(x)$ that is [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to a [[open set]] of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
