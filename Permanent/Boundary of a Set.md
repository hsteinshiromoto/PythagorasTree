# Boundary of a Set

## Definition

**Definition**. Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]], and $S\subset X$. A point $x\in X$ is said to a _boundary point_ of $S$ if $x$ belongs to the [[Closure of a Set|closure]] of $S$ and its complement, ie, $x\in\mathrm{cl}(S)\cap\mathrm{cl}(X\setminus S)$. The set of all boundary points is said to be the _boundary_ of $S$.
