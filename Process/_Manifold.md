# Manifold

## Definition

**Definition**. Let $(M, \tau_M)$ be a [[Topological Space]] and $\mathcal{A}=(U_\alpha, \varphi_\alpha)$ an [[_Atlas]]. The triple $(M, \tau_M, \mathcal{A})$ is said to be a (topological) _manifold_. 

## Intepretation

For every point $p\in M$, there exists an [[Open Set]] $U_p$ and a coordinate chart $\varphi_p:U\to\mathbb{R}^d$
