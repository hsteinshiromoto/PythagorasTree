# Differentiation Of Differental Forms

## Definition

 **Definition** ([[D. Bachman - A geometric approach to differential forms|Bac12 pp. 74]]). Let $\omega$ be an $n-$[[Differential Forms]], and $v_1,\ldots,v_{n+1}$ be $n+1$ vector fields. The operator
 $$\begin{array}{rcl}
 d:&\mathbb{R}&\to&\mathbb{R}\\
 &\omega(v_1,\ldots,v_{n+1})&\mapsto&\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}(-1)^{i+1}\dfrac{\partial \omega}{\partial v_i}(v_1,\ldots,v_{i-1},v_{i+1},\ldots,v_{n+1})
 \end{array}
$$
is said to be a *differential operator*.
