# Atlas

## Definition

**Definiton**. Let $(X, \tau_X)$ be a [[Topological Space]] If, for each set of $U_i\in\tau_X$, where $i=1,\ldots, n$, there exists a function $\varphi_i:\tau_X\to \mathbb{R}^n$ said to be a **coordinate chart**. Then, the tuple $(U_i, \varphi_i)$ is said to be an **atlas**.
